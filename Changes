David Steinbrunner (2):
      Spelling corrections

Olaf Alders (1):
      Typo fixes.

Steffen Ullrich (1):
      correct behavior for https_proxy,
      e.g. don't send plain https:// requests to proxy, but instead establish
      CONNECT tunnel and then send requests inside tunnel.
      This change does together with a change in LWP::Protocol::https.
      The change supports LWP::Protocol::https with the default
      IO::Socket::SSL backend, but also with Net::SSL. Also:
      - proxy authorization is supported (http://user:pass@host:port as proxy
        URL, Net::SSL still needs special HTTPS_PROXY_* environemt variables,
        as before)
      - CONNECT request does not need to be the first request inside the
        tunnel (not with Net::SSL)
      - conn_cache is read and written inside request(), instead of writing in
        request() and reading in _new_socket(). If a https tunnel is
        established the cache_key no longer depends only on proxy host,port
        but also on the tunnel endpoint
      - CONNECT is a proxy request and must always use Proxy-Authorization,
        not Authorization header

turugina (1):
      fix: auth-header of Digest auth did not conform to 
      RFC 2617 when WWW-Authenticate has 'qop' parameter.

_______________________________________________________________________________
2011-03-27  Release 6.02

This is the release where we try to help the CPAN-toolchain be able to install
the modules required for https-support in LWP.  We have done this by unbundling
the LWP::Protocol::https module from the libwww-perl distribution.  In order to
have https support you now need to install (or depend on) 'LWP::Protocol::https'
and then this will make sure that all the prerequsite modules comes along.
See [RT#66838].

This release also removes the old http10 modules that has really been
deprecated since v5.60.  These should have been removed at the v6.00 jump, but
I forgot.


Christopher J. Madsen (1):
      Ignores env variables when ssl_opts provided [RT#66663]

2011-03-09  Release 6.01

Add missing HTTP::Daemon dependency for the tests.



_______________________________________________________________________________
2011-03-08  Release 6.00

Unbundled all modules not in the LWP:: namespace from the libwww-perl
distribution.  The new broken out CPAN distribtions are File-Listing,
HTML-Form, HTTP-Cookies, HTTP-Daemon, HTTP-Date, HTTP-Message, HTTP-Negotiate,
Net-HTTP, and WWW-RobotRules.  libwww-perl-6 require these to be installed.

This release also drops the unmaintained lwp-rget script from the distribution.

Perl v5.8.8 or better is now required.  For older versions of perl please stay
with libwww-perl-5.837.

For https://... default to verified connections with require IO::Socket::SSL
and Mozilla::CA modules to be installed.  Old behaviour can be requested by
setting the PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME environment variable to 0.  The
LWP::UserAgent got new ssl_opts method to control this as well.

Support internationalized URLs from command line scripts and in the proxy
environment variables.

The lwp-dump script got new --request option.

The lwp-request script got new -E option, contributed by Tony Finch.

Protocol handlers and callbacks can raise HTTP::Response objects as exceptions.
This will abort the current request and make LWP return the raised response.

_______________________________________________________________________________
2009-07-07  Release 5.829

This release removes callback handlers that were left over on the returned
HTTP::Responses.  This was problematic because it created reference loops
preventing the Perl garbage collector from releasing their memory.  Another
problem was that Storable by default would not serialize these objects any
more.

This release also adds support for locating HTML::Form inputs by id or class
attribute; for instance $form->value("#foo", 42) will set the value on the
input with the ID of "foo".

_______________________________________________________________________________
2009-06-15  Release 5.827

_______________________________________________________________________________
2008-10-20  Release 5.819

Release 5.815 to 5.818 had a severe bug that sometimes made LWP not
collect all data for the responses it received.  This release is
strongly recommended as an upgrade for those releases.


Gisle Aas (2):
      Don't override $Net::HTTPS::SSL_SOCKET_CLASS if it's already set.
      Wrong content handlers would sometimes be skipped [RT#40187]


_______________________________________________________________________________
2008-10-16  Release 5.818

Main news in this release is the addition of the dump() method to the
request and response objects.  If found that I often ended up printing
$resp->as_string for debugging and then regretting after the terminal
got into a strange mode or just kept on scrolling for the longest
time.


Gisle Aas (8):
      Use deflate compression instead of gzip for the test
      Simplify; Get rid of the $USE_STORABLE_DCLONE configuration
      Add dump method to HTTP::Message.
      Use $res->dump instead of rolling our own.
      Layout change; move headers() methods to a more logical place.
      Add support for x-bzip2 encoding; fix bzip2 decoding.
      Add send_header method to HTTP::Daemon
      Make the lwp-request User-Agent string include the LWP version.

Slaven Rezic (1):
      clone implemented in terms of Storable::dclone [RT#39611]


_______________________________________________________________________________
2008-10-10  Release 5.817

This is the release where I played around with Devel::NYTProf to
figure where time was actually spent during the processing of requests
with LWP.  The methods that manipulated header objects stood out, so
this release contains a few tweaks to make those parts faster.

I also figured a few convenience methods to encode and decode the
content of request/response objects would be in order.


Gisle Aas (16):
      Should store "wire" headers field names with _ without translation.
      Test HTTP::Request->parse().
      Restore pre-5.815 behaviour of returning "400 Bad Request" [RT#39694]
      Rename the HTTP::Status constants to have HTTP_ prefix
      Detection of unsupported schemes was broken [RT#37637]
      Allow tainted methods to be forwarded to HTTP::Headers [RT#38736]
      Add strict mode to HTML::Form
      Fix test now that less warnings are generated.
      Add content_is_xml method
      Make split_header_words() lower case returned tokens/keys
      Avoid invoking AUTOLOAD on object destruction [RT#39852]
      Add decode() method to HTTP::Message
      Add encode() method to HTTP::Message
      Allow multiple fields to be set with push_header().
      Make content_type and content_is_xhtml methods faster
      Faster push_header()


_______________________________________________________________________________
2008-09-29  Release 5.816

Oops, release 5.815 broke download-to-file on Windows.


Gisle Aas (2):
      Add missing binmode() [RT#39668]
      Doc tweaks


_______________________________________________________________________________
2008-09-24  Release 5.815

The main change this time is the introduction of handlers to drive the
processing of requests in LWP::UserAgent.  You can also register your
own handlers for modifying and processing requests or responses on
their way, which I think is a much more flexible approach that trying
to subclass LWP::UserAgent to customize it.  If we have had these
early on then the LWP::UserAgent API could have been so much simpler
as the effect of most current attributes can easily be set up with
trivial handlers.

Also thanks to contributions by Bron Gondwana LWP's Basic/Digest
authenticate modules now registers handlers which allow them to
automatically fill in the Authorization headers without first taking
the round-trip of a 401 response when LWP knows the credentials for a

    Get rid of t/live/validator test.  Too much JavaScript madness
    for it to be a sane LWP test.



2007-07-31   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.807
     
    Apply patch correction from CPAN RT #26152

    More laxed t/live/validator test.



2007-07-19   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.806

    Added progress callback to LWP::UserAgent.
     
    HTTP::Daemon didn't avoid content in responses to HEAD requests

    Add support for HTTP Expect header to HTTP::Daemon (CPAN RT #27933)

    Fix t/base/message.t so tests are skipped if Encode is not
    installed.  (CPAN RT #25286)

    Add HTML::Tagset as a prerequisite to Makefile.PL

    Do not clobber $_ in LWP::Protocol::nntp (CPAN RT #25132)

    Fix lwp-download so it can download files with an "_" in the filename
        (CPAN RT#26207)

    Quiet complaints from HTML::HeadParser when dealing with undecoded
    UTF-8 data.  (CPAN RT#20274)

    When both IO::Socket::SSL and Net::SSL are loaded, use the latter
        (CPAN RT #26152)

    Allows SSL to work much more reliably:

    Added chunked test by Andreas J. Koenig



2005-12-08   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.805

    HTTP::Date: The str2time function returned wrong values for
    years in the early 20th century, because timelocal() actually
    expects the year to be provided on a different scale than what
    localtime() returns.

    HTTP::Headers can now be constructed with field names that repeat.
    The $h->header function now also accept repeating field
    names and can also remove headers if passed undef as value.

    HTML::Form: The parse method now takes hash style optional
    arguments and the old verbose behaviour is now off by default.
    
    HTML::Form: Accept <select multiple=""> for compatibility with
    other browsers.  Patch by Josh Rai <josh@rai.name>.

    HTML::Form: Sane handling of 'disabled' for ListInput.
    Based on patch by Joao Lopes <developer@st3tailor.com.br>.

    HTTP::Negotiate: Fixed matching of partial language tags.
    Patch contributed by Dan Kubb.

    HTTP::Response: The as_string method now returns a status line
    that doesn't add the "official" code name in the message
    field.  This improves the ability to round-trip response objects
    via HTTP::Response->parse($res->as_string) and makes the first
    line of the string returned agree with $res->status_line.

    Net::HTTP: The host attribute can now be set undef in
    order to suppress this header for HTTP/1.0 requests.

    Net::HTTP: The default Host: header does not include the
    port number if it is the default (80 for plain HTTP). Some
    servers get confused by this.

    Net::HTTP: Ignore bogus Content-Length headers. Don't get
    confused by leading or trailing whitespace.

    LWP::Protocol::http: More efficient sending of small PUT/POST
    requests by trying harder to pass off the whole request in a
    single call to syswrite.

    lwp-request now give better error messages if you used the 
    -o option without having the HTML-Tree distribution installed.
    Also document this dependency.



2005-12-06   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.804

    HTTP::Message->parse did not work when the first line of the body
    was something that looked like a header.

    HTTP::Header::Auth needs HTTP::Headers to be loaded before
    it replace its functions.

    LWP::Protocol::nntp improvements by Ville Skyttä <ville.skytta@iki.fi>:
     - Support the nntp: scheme.
     - Support hostname in news: and nntp: URIs.
     - Close connection and preserve headers also in non-OK responses.
     - HEAD support for URIs identifying a newsgroup.
     - Comment spelling fixes.

    Fix quotes in Net::HTTP example.
    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=283916

    Detect EOF when expecting a chunk header.  Should address the
    warnings shown in http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=286775

    WWW::RobotRules: Improved parsing of not strictly valid robots.txt files
    contributed by <Matthew.van.Eerde@hbinc.com>.

    Makefile.PL: Set name to LWP so that the .packlist ends up in the
    expected place.



2004-12-11   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.803

    HTTP::Message: $mess->decoded_content sometimes had the side
    effect of destroying $mess->content.

    HTTP::Message: $mess->decoded_content failed for
    "Content-Encoding: deflate" if the content was not in the
    zlib-format as specified for the HTTP protocol.  Microsoft got
    this wrong, so we have to support raw deflate bytes as well.

    HTTP::Response->parse don't require the protocol to be
    specified any more.  This allows HTTP::Response->parse($resp->as_string)
    to round-trip.  Patch by Harald Joerg <haj@oook.m.uunet.de>.

    HTTP::Response: $resp->base might now return undef.  Previously
    it would croak if there was no associated request.  Based on
    patch by Harald Joerg <haj@oook.m.uunet.de>.

    HTML::Form now support <label> for check- and radio boxes.
    Patch contributed by Dan Kubb <dan.kubb@onautopilot.com>.

    Make HTTP::Daemon subclassable, patch by Kees Cook <kees@osdl.org>.

    lwp-download allow directory to save into to be specified.
    Patch by Radoslaw Zielinski <radek@karnet.pl>.

    lwp-download will validate filename derived from server
    controlled data and will fail if something looks not
    quite right.

  

2004-11-30   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.802

    The HTTP::Message object now has a decoded_content() method.
    This will return the content after any Content-Encodings and
    charsets have been decoded.

    Compress::Zlib is now a prerequisite module.

    HTTP::Request::Common: The POST() function created an invalid
    Content-Type header for file uploads with no parameters.

    Net::HTTP: Allow Transfer-Encoding with trailing whitespace.
    <http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3929>

    Net::HTTP: Don't allow empty content to be treated as a valid
    HTTP/0.9 response.
    <http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=4581>
    <http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=6883>

    File::Protocol::file: Fixup directory links in HTML generated
    for directories.  Patch by Moshe Kaminsky <kaminsky@math.huji.ac.il>.

    Makefile.PL will try to discover misconfigured systems that
    can't talk to themselves and disable tests that depend on this.

    Makefile.PL will now default to 'n' when asking about whether
    to install the "GET", "HEAD", "POST" programs.  There has been
    too many name clashes with these common names.



2004-11-12   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.801

    HTTP::Message improved content/content_ref interaction.  Fixes
    DYNAMIC_FILE_UPLOAD and other uses of code content in requests.

    HTML::Form:
      - Handle clicking on nameless image.
      - Don't let $form->click invoke a disabled submit button.

    HTTP::Cookies could not handle a "old-style" cookie named
    "Expires".

    HTTP::Headers work-around for thread safety issue in perl <= 5.8.4.

    HTTP::Request::Common improved documentation.

    LWP::Protocol: Check that we can write to the file specified in
    $ua->request(..., $file) or $ua->mirror.

    LWP::UserAgent clone() dies if proxy was not set.  Patch by
    Andy Lester <andy@petdance.com>

    HTTP::Methods now avoid "use of uninitialized"-warning when server
    replies with incomplete status line.

    lwp-download will now actually tell you why it aborts if it runs
    out of disk space of fails to write some other way.

    WWW::RobotRules: only display warning when running under 'perl -w'
    and show which robots.txt file they correspond to.  Based on
    patch by Bill Moseley.

    WWW::RobotRules: Don't empty cache when agent() is called if the
    agent name does not change.  Patch by Ville Skyttä <ville.skytta@iki.fi>.



2004-06-16   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.800

    HTML::Form will allow individual menu entries to be disabled.
    This was needed to support <input type=radio disabled value=foo>
    and <select><option disabled>foo.

    HTML::Form now avoids name clashes between the <select> and
    <option> attributes.

    HTML::Form now implicitly close <select> elements when it sees
    another input or </form>.  This is closer to the MSIE behaviour.

    HTML::Form will now "support" keygen-inputs.  It will not
    calculate a key by itself.  The user will have to set its
    value for it to be returned by the form.

    HTTP::Headers now special case field names that start with a
    ':'.   This is used as an escape mechanism when you need the
    header names to not go through canonicalization.  It means
    that you can force LWP to use a specific casing and even
    underscores in header names.  The ugly $TRANSLATE_UNDERSCORE
    global has been undocumented as a result of this.

    HTTP::Message will now allow an external 'content_ref'
    to be set.  This can for instance be used to let HTTP::Request
    objects pick up content data from some scalar variable without
    having to copy it.

    HTTP::Request::Common.  The individual parts will no longer
    have a Content-Length header for file uploads.  This improves
    compatibility with "normal" browsers.

    LWP::Simple doc patch for getprint.
    Contributed by Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes <sthoenna@efn.org>.

    LWP::UserAgent: New methods default_header() and
    default_headers().  These can be used to set up headers that
    are automatically added to requests as they are sent.  This
    can for instance be used to initialize various Accept headers.

    Various typo fixes by Ville Skyttä <ville.skytta@iki.fi>.

    Fixed test failure under perl-5.005.
    
    LWP::Protocol::loopback:  This is a new protocol handler that
    works like the HTTP TRACE method, it will return the request
    provided to it.  This is sometimes useful for testing.  It can
    for instance be invoked by setting the 'http_proxy' environment
    variable to 'loopback:'.



2004-04-13   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.79

    HTML::Form now exposes the 'readonly' and 'disabled'
    attribute for inputs.  This allows your program to simulate
    JavaScript code that modifies these attributes.

    RFC 2616 says that http: referer should not be sent with
    https: requests.  The lwp-rget program, the $req->referer method
    and the redirect handling code now try to enforce this.
    Patch by Ville Skyttä <ville.skytta@iki.fi>.

    WWW::RobotRules now look for the string found in
    robots.txt as a case insensitive substring from its own
    User-Agent string, not the other way around.
    Patch by Ville Skyttä <ville.skytta@iki.fi>.

    HTTP::Headers: New method 'header_field_names' that
    return a list of names as suggested by its name.

    HTTP::Headers: $h->remove_content_headers will now
    also remove the headers "Allow", "Expires" and
    "Last-Modified".  These are also part of the set
    that RFC 2616 denote as Entity Header Fields.

    HTTP::Headers: $h->content_type is now more careful
    in removing embedded space in the returned value.
    It also now returns all the parameters as the second
    return value as documented.

    HTTP::Headers: $h->header() now croaks.  It used to
    silently do nothing.

    HTTP::Headers: Documentation tweaks.  Documented a
    few bugs discovered during testing.

    Typo fixes to the documentation all over the place
    by Ville Skyttä <ville.skytta@iki.fi>.

    Updated tests.



2004-04-07   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.78

    Removed stray Data::Dump reference from test suite.
    
    Added the parse(), clear(), parts() and add_part() methods to
    HTTP::Message.  The HTTP::MessageParts module of 5.77 is no more.

    Added clear() and remove_content_headers() methods to
    HTTP::Headers.

    The as_string() method of HTTP::Message now appends a newline
    if called without arguments and the non-empty content does
    not end with a newline.  This ensures better compatibility with
    5.76 and older versions of libwww-perl.

    Use case insensitive lookup of hostname in $ua->credentials.
    Patch by Andrew Pimlott <andrew@pimlott.net>.



2004-04-06   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.77

    LWP::Simple did not handle redirects properly when the "Location"
    header used uncommon letter casing.
    Patch by Ward Vandewege <ward@pong.be>.

    LWP::UserAgent passed the wrong request to redirect_ok().
    Patch by Ville Skyttä <ville.skytta@iki.fi>.
    https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=5828

    LWP did not handle URLs like http://www.example.com?foo=bar
    properly.

    LWP::RobotUA construct now accept key/value arguments in the
    same way as LWP::UserAgent.
    Based on patch by Andy Lester <andy@petdance.com>.

    LWP::RobotUA did not parse robots.txt files that contained
    "Disallow:" using uncommon letter casing.
    Patch by Liam Quinn <liam@htmlhelp.com>.

    WWW::RobotRules now allow leading space when parsing robots.txt
    file as suggested by Craig Macdonald <craig@freeasphost.co.uk>.
    We now also allow space before the colon.

    WWW::RobotRules did not handle User-Agent names that use complex
    version numbers.  Patch by Liam Quinn <liam@htmlhelp.com>.

    Case insensitive handling of hosts and domain names
    in HTTP::Cookies.
    https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=4530

    The bundled media.types file now match video/quicktime
    with the .mov extension, as suggested by Michel Koppelaar
    <Michel.Koppelaar@kb.nl>.

    Experimental support for composite messages, currently
    implemented by the HTTP::MessageParts module.  Based on
    ideas from Joshua Hoblitt <jhoblitt@ifa.hawaii.edu>.

    Fixed libscan in Makefile.PL.
    Patch by Andy Lester <andy@petdance.com>.

    The HTTP::Message constructor now accept a plain array reference
    as its $headers argument.

    The return value of the HTTP::Message as_string() method now
    better conforms to the HTTP wire layout.  No additional "\n"
    are appended to the as_string value for HTTP::Request and
    HTTP::Response.  The HTTP::Request as_string now replace missing
    method or URI with "-" instead of "[NO METHOD]" and "[NO URI]".
    We don't want values with spaces in them, because it makes it
    harder to parse.



2003-11-21   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.76
    
    Revised handling of redirects.
       - clear our content and content headers if we
         rewrite request as GET based on patch by
         Steven Butler <stevenb@kjross.com.au>.
       - pass $response to redirect_ok()

    Support cpan:-URLs.  Try 'lwp-download cpan:src/latest.tar.gz' :)

    Fix test failure in 't/html/form.t' for perl5.005.



2003-10-26   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.75
    
    Reworked LWP::UserAgent, HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response
    documentation.  Also other documentation tweaks.



2003-10-23   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.74

    Improved lwp-download program:
      - set mtime if Last-Modified header reported by server
      - better prompts
      - avoid warnings when aborted at the wrong time

    Collected all contributions in the AUTHORS file and
    also added an AUTHORS section to the LWP manpage.

    Style tweaks to all modules.  Move POD after __END__
    and uncuddled elses.



2003-10-19   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.73
    
    Takanori Ugai <ugai@jp.fujitsu.com> found that 'max_redirect'
    introduced in 5.72 was broken and provided a patch for that.

    Not all ftp servers return 550 responses when trying to
    to RETR a directory.  Microsoft's IIS is one of those.
    Patch provided by Thomas Lotterer <thl@dev.de.cw.com>.
    
    Some documentation tweaks.



2003-10-15   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.72

    Requests for some non-HTTP URLs would fail if the cookie_jar
    was enabled.  The HTTP::Cookies::add_cookie_header now ignore
    non-HTTP requests.

    The new local/http test failed on Windows because of a missing
    binmode().

    Suppress Client-SSL-Warning warning header when Crypt::SSLeay
    is able to verify the peer certificate.   Patch contributed by
    Joshua Chamas <joshua@chamas.com>.

    HTTP::Request::Common::POST did not add a 'Content-Length' header
    when the content ended up empty.  Fixed by a patch contributed
    by Brian J. Murrell.

    Internally generated responses now contain a text/plain part
    that repeats the status line.  They also have a "Client-Warning"
    header that can be used to differentiate these responses from
    real server responses.

    LWP::UserAgent now deals with 303 and 307 redirects.  The behaviour
    of 302 redirects has also changed to be like 303; i.e. change the
    method to be "GET".  This is what most browsers do.  Based on
    a patch contributed by Tom Hughes <thh@cyberscience.com>.

    LWP::UserAgent now implements a 'max_redirect' attribute with a
    default value of 7.  This should also fix the problem where
    redirects to the same URL to get a cookie set did not work.
    Based on a patch by Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>.

    NTLM authentication should continue to fail if the Authen::NTLM
    module can't be loaded.  LWP used to think the scheme was
    available as soon as the module stash showed up.  Not it looks
    for the authenticate method to be defined.  Patch by Jan Dubois.

    lwp-download will not try to rename *.tbz and *.tar.bz2 to
    match the reported content type.  Patch contributed by
    Robin Barker <Robin.Barker@npl.co.uk>.

    HTTP::Cookies::Netscape documentation fix by Sean M. Burke.

    HTTP::Cookies::Microsoft documentation fix by Johnny Lee.

    The code that tries to avoid installing 'HEAD' on top of
    'head' on systems like Mac OS was further improved to look
    in $Config{installscript} instead of $Config{sitebin}.
    Patch provided by Ken Williams <ken@mathforum.org>.



2003-10-14   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.71

    Support open-ended Range: header for ftp requests.
    Patch by Matthew Eldridge <eldridge@Graphics.Stanford.EDU>.

    lwp-request now prints unsuccessful responses in the same way
    as successful ones.  The status will still indicate failures.
    Based on a patch by Steve Hay <steve.hay@uk.radan.com>.

    HTML::Form's dump now also print alternative value names.

    HTML::Form will now pick up the phrase after a <input type=radio>
    or <input type=checkbox> and use that as the name of the checked
    value.

    HTML::Form's find_input now returns all inputs that match in
    array context.  Based on patch by Mark Stosberg <markstos@cpan.org>
    in <http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3320>.

    HTTP::Daemon's send_file() method did not work when given
    a file name.  Patch by Dave W. Smith <dws@postcognitive.com>.

    HTTP::Daemon is less strict about field names in the request
    headers is received.  The Norton Internet Security firewall
    apparently likes to send requests with a header called
    '~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'.   Further details in
    <http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2531>.

    LWP::Protocol::http assumed $1 would be meaningful without
    testing the outcome of the match.  This sometimes produced
    an extra garbage Authentication header.
    Based on the patch by <bai@dreamarts.co.jp> in
    <http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=1994>.

    LWP::Protocol::mailto will try harder to locate the sendmail
    program as suggested in <http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2363>.
    Also let $ENV{SENDMAIL} override the search.

    Patch to enable OS/2 build by Ilya Zakharevich.



2003-10-13   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.70

    File::Listing::apache by Slaven Rezic <slaven@rezic.de>

    HEAD requests now work properly for ftp: URLs.
    Patch by Ville Skyttä <ville.skytta@iki.fi>.

    LWP::UserAgent: The protocols_allowed() and protocols_forbidden()
    methods are now case insensitive.  Patch by Ville Skyttä
    <ville.skytta@iki.fi>.

    Avoid warning from HTTP::Date on certain invalid dates.
    Patch by David Dick <david_dick@iprimus.com.au>.

    HTML::Form::param() is an alternative interface for inspecting
    and modifying the form values.  It resembles the interface
    of CGI.

    HTML::Form documentation updated.  Lots of typo fixes and improves
    by Martin Thurn <mthurn@northropgrumman.com>.

    HTML::Form will treat any unknown input types as text input.
    This appears to be what most browsers do.

    HTML::Form::parse() can now take a HTTP::Response object
    as argument.

    The "checkbox" and "option" inputs of HTML::Form can now be
    turned on with the new check() method.

    The inputs of HTML::Form can now track alternative value
    names and allow values to be set by these names as well.
    Currently this is only supported for "option" inputs.

    HTML::Form's dump() method now print the name of the form if
    present.



2003-01-24   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.69

    Include lwptut.pod contributed by Sean M. Burke C<sburke@cpan.org>.

    The lwp-request aliases GET, HEAD, POST where installed when
    no program should be.  Fixed by David Miller <dave@justdave.net>.

    lwp-rget --help don't print double usage any more.

    HTTP::Header::Util is now more reluctant to put quotes around
    token values.

    Net::HTTP: Avoid warning on unexpected EOF when reading chunk
    header.



2003-01-02   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.68

    Fix test failure for t/html/form.t when running under
    perl-5.8.0.



2003-01-01   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.67

    HTTP::Cookies::Microsoft contributed by Johnny Lee <typo_pl@hotmail.com>.
    This module makes it possible for LWP to share MSIE's cookies.

    HTML::Form supports file upload better now.  There are some
    new methods on that kind of input; file(), filename(), content()
    and headers().

    Removed unfinished test that depended on Data::Dump.

    Net::HTTP avoids exceptions in read_response_headers() with
    laxed option.  It now always assumes HTTP/0.9 on unexpected
    responses.

    HTML::Form documentation reworked.



2002-12-20   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.66

    Various patches from Sean M. Burke.  Most of them to
    match up LWP with the "Perl & LWP" book.

    LWP::DebugFile module contributed by Sean.

    LWP::Authen::Ntml contributed by James Tillman.

    HTTP::Daemon patch for Alpha by <shildreth@emsphone.com>

    The format_chunk() and write_chunk() methods of Net::HTTP
    did not work.  Bug spotted by Yale Huang <yale@sdf-eu.org>.

    The Client-Peer response header is back.



2002-05-31   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.65

    Make HTTP::Date compatible with perl 5.8.

    Try to avoid to default to overwriting /usr/bin/head 
    on MacOS X when the perl install prefix is /usr/bin.

    HTTP::Cookies fix for parsing of Netscape cookies file
    on MS Windows. Patch by by Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>.

    HTTP::Negotiate doc patch from Edward Avis <epa98@doc.ic.ac.uk>.



2002-02-09   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.64

    Simplified the Makefile.PL:
       - the scripts are not longer *.PL files

       - don't try to make symlinks for GET, HEAD, POST
         as that has not worked for a long time

       - the GET, HEAD, POST aliases for lwp-request should
         now work on Windows.
    
    HTTP::Cookies:
       - added 'clear_temporary_cookies' method;
         patch by Mike Schilli <schilli1@pacbell.net>.

       - trailing space in old cookie parameters not ignored;
         patch by Ivan Panchenko

       - protect against $SIG{__DIE__} handlers;
	 patch by Adam Newby <adam@NewsNow.co.uk>.

    LWP::Authen::Digest:
       - abort digest auth session if we fail repeatedly with
         the same username/password.

    MacOS portability patches to the test suite by
    Chris Nandor <pudge@pobox.com>.



2001-12-14   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.63

    HTTP::Negotiate: Deal with parameter names in a case
    insensitive way.  Put a little weight on the order of features
    in the Accept headers.

    LWP::UserAgent: make sure that the 'request' attribute is
    always set on the returned response.

    LWP::Protocol::http will now allow certain bad headers
    in the responses it reads.  The bad headers end up in the
    header 'Client-Junk'.

    Net::HTTP new options to the 'read_response_headers'
    method.  The option 'laxed' will make it ignore bad header
    lines.  The option 'junk_out' can be used to pass in an
    array reference.  Junk header lines are pushed onto it.

    Net::HTTP::Methods: fixed the internal zlib_ok() to also
    return the correct value the first time.

    LWP::Protocol::http: Ensure that we don't read until
    select has said it is ok since we have put the socket
    in non-blocking mode.  Previously this could happen if
    you set the 'timeout' attribute of the user agent to 0.

    LWP::Authen::Digest now use Digest::MD5 instead of MD5.

    Some adjustments to Makefile.PL to figure out if
    Compress::Zlib is available and adjust the test suite
    accordingly.



2001-11-21   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.62

    The $VERSION of LWP::UserAgent wrapped around.  This confused the
    CPAN indexer.  Bumped the major number to 2 to fix this.

    Net::HTTP did not work well on perl5.003.  The PeerHost argument
    to IO::Socket::INET was not recognized, so we had to use PeerAddr
    instead.  The syswrite() method also required a length argument.

    Net::HTTP did not deal with transfer encoding tokens in a
    case-insensitive way.  Patch by Blair Zajac <blair@orcaware.com>.

    The jigsaw-chunk test failed on MacOS because "\n" is different.
    Patch by Chris Nandor <pudge@pobox.com>.



2001-11-16   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.61

    LWP::Protocol::http did not invoke its _fixup_header method.
    The result was that the 'Host' header got completely wrong
    when talking through a proxy server.

    The live Google test is gone.  They blocked us.

    The guts of Net::HTTP has moved to Net::HTTP::Methods.

    Net::HTTP now has limits on the size of the header which are
    set by default.

    New module Net::HTTPS.

    Documentation tweaks.

    HTTP::Headers: The 'remove_header' method now return the values
    of the fields removed as suggested by Blair Zajac <blair@orcaware.com>.
    Also a typo fix by Blair.

    HTTP::Message: The delegation via &AUTOLOAD should be slightly
    faster now.  It will install a real forwarding function the
    first time it is called for each HTTP::Headers method.

    LWP::UserAgent: Don't forward 'Cookie' headers on redirect.
    Patch by Steve A Fink <steve@fink.com>.

    LWP::Protocol::http has been reorganized to make it simpler
    to subclass it. Other minor changes to it include:
       - Client-Warning is gone
       - Client-Request-Num renamed to Client-Response-Num
       - A 'Transfer-Encoding' header is rewritten into a
         'Client-Transfer-Encoding' header.

    LWP::Protocol::https is completely redone.



2001-10-26   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.60

    Made HTTP/1.1 the default.  The old HTTP/1.0 module has been
    renamed as LWP::Protocol::http10.  There is an environment
    variable; PERL_LWP_USE_HTTP_10 that can be set to have LWP
    still pick up the old drivers.

    Deal with "100 continue" responses even when not requested by
    and Expect header in the request.  MS IIS seems to eager to send
    this kind of response.

    For HTTP/1.1 over SSL there was a problem with the underlying
    SSL libraries if the socket was configured to non-blocking mode.
    Disable this for https.
    Based on a patch from Michael Thompson <mickey@berkeley.innomedia.com>

    Support the Range header for ftp:// requests.
    Patch by David Coppit <david@coppit.org>.

    Rearrange Bundle::LWP on request from Chris Nandor.

    HTTP::Cookies: Allow a domain like .foo.com match host "foo.com".
    Patch by Alexandre Duret-Lutz <duret_g@lrde.epita.fr>

    For redirects make sure Host header is not copied to the new
    request.

    The HTML::HeadParser is not loaded until actually needed.

    Net::HTTP should now work with perl5.005 by a simple tweak
    to 'require IO::Socket::INET'.

    WWW::RobotRules::AnyDBM: Explicitly clear database on open.
    Some DBM implementations doesn't support the O_TRUNC flag
    properly.  Patch by Radu Greab <radu@netsoft.ro>.



2001-09-19   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53_97

    LWP::Protocol::http11: fix socket leak.  Because we managed
    to set up a circular reference within the sockets objects they
    stayed around forever.

    LWP::UserAgent: Split up simple_request into prepare_request
    and send_request. Patch contributed by Keiichiro Nagano <knagano@sodan.org>

    LWP::Protocol::http: Pass all header data to LWP::Debug::conns.
    Based on patch by Martijn.

    LWP::UserAgent: Sean fixed a Cut&Paste error.

    HTTP::Cookies: avoid pack("c",...) warning from bleadperl.



2001-08-27   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53_96

    HTTP/1.1 support also for https.
    Contributed by Doug MacEachern <dougm@covalent.net>

    The HTTP/1.1 modules are now enabled by default.  Hope that will give
    them more testing than they otherwise would have gotten.

    HTTP::Daemon's accept now has same behaviour as IO::Socket's
    accept in list context.  Fixed by Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

    More argument sanity checking in HTTP::Request->uri and
    LWP::UserAgent->simple_request.  Patch by Sean M. Burke.

    HTTP::Protocol::http.  Deal with short writes.
    Patch by Norton Allen <allen@huarp.harvard.edu>

    HTTP::Protocol::http11:  Deal with newlines in header values.

    Net::HTTP: call sysread (instead of xread) when more data is required.



2001-08-06   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53_95

    Fix HTTP::Cookies where there is a mix of Set-Cookie and
    Set-Cookie2 headers.  In that case we used to ignore all Set-Cookie
    headers.  Now we only ignore those Set-Cookie headers that reference
    the same cookie as a Set-Cookie2 header.

    HTTP::Request, HTTP::Response will by default now use "URI" class,
    instead of "URI::URL", when constructing its URI objects.  This
    has a potential for breaking existing code as URI::URL objects had
    some extra methods that external code might depend upon.

    Patches by Sean M. Burke:
       - Fix treatment of language tags in HTTP::Negotiate 
       - Avoid trailing newline in $response->message
       - HTTP::Response clarifications

    LWP::Simple deals with non-absolute redirects "correctly" now.

    Net::HTTP does not try to load Compress::Zlib until it is needed.

    Net::HTTP documentation has been updated.



2001-05-05   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53_94

    Sean M. Burke's update to LWP::UserAgent:
       - updated redirect_ok behaviour
       - new convenience methods: get/head/post/put
       - protocols_allowed/protocols_forbidden
       - LWP::Protocol::nogo (new module)

    Added digest auth test against Jigsaw

    Fixed a 'use of uninitialized'-warning in the handling of
    digest authentication.

    Net::HTTP updates:
      - new option: SendTE
      - support transfer-encoding 'deflate' and 'gzip' (when Compress::Zlib
        is available).
      - new methods: format_chunk, format_chunk_eof
      - use -1 (instead of "0E0" as signal that no data was available,
        but this was not EOF).



2001-04-28   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53_93

    Makefile.PL now asks some questions

    Added live tests for the new HTTP/1.1 support

    LWP::MemberMixin: make it possible to set a value to the 'undef' value.

    Net::HTTP:
        - transparent support for 'deflate' and 'gzip' transfer encodings
          (need to have the Compress::Zlib module installed for this to work).



2001-04-25   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53_92

    LWP::Protocol::ftp now support keep-alives too.  The command
    connection will stay open if keep-alives are enabled.

    LWP::Protocol::http11 various fixes:
        - chunked request content did not work
        - monitor connection while sending request content
        - deal with Expect: 100-continue

    LWP::RobotUA: Protect host_port call.  Not all URIs have this method.



2001-04-20   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53_91

    Introduced LWP::ConnCache module.  Works similar to HTTP::Cookies,
    it that it takes effect if associated with the $ua.

    The handling of $ua->max_size changed to make 0 mean 0
    (not unlimited).  A value of undef means no limit.
    The X-Content-Base header is gone.  I hope nobody relies on
    it.  It might come back if people start to scream.  There
    is a new Client-Aborted header instead.

    The Range header generated for $ua->max_size had an off-by-one
    error.  A range of "0-1" means 2 bytes.

    The LWP::UserAgent constructor now takes configuration arguments.

    Keep-alive and the new HTTP/1.1 module can now be simply
    enabled with something like:

          LWP::UserAgent->new(keep_alive => 1);

    New method $ua->conn_cache to set up and access the associated
    connection manager.

    If the string passed to $ua->agent() ends with space then
    the "libwww-perl/#.##" string is automatically appended.

    New method $ua->_agent

    Passing a plain hash to $ua->cookie_jar automatically loads
    HTTP::Cookies and initialise an object using the hash content
    as constructor arguments.

    LWP::Protocol::http11 now use the conn_cache of the $ua.

    LWP::Protocol::http11 now added a few new Client- headers.

    LWP::Protocol avoid keeping the connection alive if $ua->max_size
    limit prevents the whole body content from being read.

    Net::HTTP updates:
       - new methods: write_chunk(), write_chunk_eof()
       - reset state properly when a new body is read.
       - always set read buffer empty on eof
       - doc update

    WWW::RobotRules patch by Liam Quinn <liam@htmlhelp.com>:
       - Always qualify netloc with port.
       - Reverse User-Agent substring matching.



2001-04-18   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53_90

    Note: This is a developer only release.  Not for production use.

    LWP::Protocol::http11 now does keep-alives by default.  Still need
    to figure out what interface to provide at the $ua level.

    LWP::Protocol::http11 deals with CODE content in request.

    Net::HTTP updated:
        - added format_request() method
        - added _rbuf and _rbuf_length methods
        - read_response_headers does not return protocol version
	  any more.
        - peer_http_version method did not work because of typo.
        - documentation added

    New module Net::HTTP::NB.  This is a Net::HTTP subclass that
    is better suited for multiplexing as it is able to do no-blocking
    reads of headers and entity body chunks.

    HTTP::Request: Protect $request->uri against evil $SIG{__DIE__} handlers.

    Some reorganisation in how stuff is passed from $ua to protocol object.
    The $ua is now passed in so protocol objects might store start in it.

    The $ua->max_size default is now 0.

    The $ua->clone method avoids sharing of proxy settings between
    the old and the new.

    This file is renamed to 'Changes' (used to be 'ChangeLog').



2001-04-10   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53

    LWP::Simple::get() could sometimes return nothing on failure in
    list context.  Now it always returns 'undef'.

    HTTP::Cookies does not request 2 dots on domain names any more.
    New option to hide the Cookie2 header.  Cookie2 header now quote
    the version number. Updated reference to RFC 2965.

    Support for embedded userinfo in http proxy URIs.  It means that
    you know can set up your proxy with things like:
        http_proxy="http://proxyuser:proxypass@proxyhost:port"
    Patch by John Klar <j.klar@xpedite.com>.

    Experimental HTTP/1.1 support.  New module called Net::HTTP that
    provide the lower level interface and a LWP::Protocol::http11
    module that builds on it.  The HTTP/1.1 protocol module must be
    loaded and registered explicitly, otherwise the old and trustworthy
    HTTP/1.0 module will be used.

    LWP::Protocol::GHTTP will try to use the get_headers() methods
    so that it can actually extract all the headers.



2001-03-29   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.52

    HTTP::Header: new method $h->init_header() that will only
    set the header if it is not already set.  Some shuffling
    around in the code.

    LWP::UserAgent will not override 'User-Agent', 'From'
    or 'Range' headers if they are explicitly set in the
    request passed in.

    HTML::Form tries to optimize parsing be restricting the
    tags that are reported by HTML::Parser.  Will need
    HTML::Parser v3.19_93 or better for this to actually
    have any effect.

    LWP::Protocol::ftp now deals with path parameters again.
    It means that you can append ";type=a" to ftp-URI and
    it will download the document in ASCII mode.

    If the server output multiple Location headers on a redirect,
    ignore all but the first one.

    Extract cookies failed on request URIs with empty paths.
    This was only triggered if you used URI objects directly in
    scripts.

    This change was actually part of 5.51:  Fix qop="auth"
    handling for Digest authentication.
    Patch by Dave Dunkin <dave_dunkin@hotmail.com>.



2001-03-14   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.51

    SECURITY FIX: If LWP::UserAgent::env_proxy is called in a CGI
    environment, the case-insensitivity when looking for "http_proxy"
    permits "HTTP_PROXY" to be found, but this can be trivially set by the
    web client using the "Proxy:" header.  The fix applied is that
    $ENV{HTTP_PROXY} is not longer honored for CGI scripts.
    The CGI_HTTP_PROXY environment variable can be used instead.
    Problem reported by Randal L. Schwartz.

    NOTE: It is recommended that everybody that use LWP::UserAgent
          (including LWP::Simple) in CGI scripts upgrade to this release.

    Explicit setting of action on HTML::Form had no effect because
    of a code typo.  Patch by BooK <book@netcourrier.com>.

    HTTP::Daemon: The CONNECT method need special treatment because
    it does not provide a URI as argument (just a "hostname:port").
    The non-upward compatibility warning is that you must now call
    $request->url->host_port to get the host/port string for CONNECT,
    rather than calling $request->url and using the entire string.
    Based on patch from Randal L. Schwartz <merlyn@stonehenge.com>

    HTTP::Daemon: Create self URL based on $self->sockaddr.  This works
    better when LocalAddr is used to specify the port number.  Based on
    patch from Ben Low <ben@snrc.uow.edu.au>. 

    Avoid potential '<FILE> chunk 1' messages at the end of the response
    'message'.



2001-01-12   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.50

    Fix for test cases that failed because of URI-1.10 now encode
    space as '+' instead of '%20. Patch by Christian Gilmore
    <cgilmore@tivoli.com>.

    Makefile.PL: Require URI-1.10.

    HTTP::Daemon now accepts any non-space character as method name
    on the request line.  It used to fail on methods like "M-POST"
    because it only allowed \w-chars.

    HTTP::Date now allow fractional seconds in ISO date formats.
    Based on patch from Mark D. Anderson <mda@discerning.com>

    HTTP::Request::Common will now calculate Content-length
    even if $DYNAMIC_FILE_UPLOAD is set.  Patch provided by
    Lindley, Lee T <Lee.Lindley@viasystems.com>.



2000-12-31   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

 o  HTTP::Cookies now ignore the Expires field in Set-Cookie, if the
    date provided can't be parsed by HTTP::Date.

    It means that 'lwp-request perl' will not get a file called "./perl"
    but will fetch the page "http://www.perl.com" or something similar.
    If you want to get the file you have to prefix it with "./".  Full
    URLs are never affected by this.

 o  LWP::Simple::get() will bypass LWP for simple HTTP requests.  This
    should make it somewhat faster.

 o  LWP::RobotUA has a new method called $ua->use_sleep() that

    document better. Initial patch from Nicolai Langfeldt
    <janl@math.uio.no>.

    more.  I wonder how Netscape managed to not implement this
    correctly all this time.

 o  Added lots of modern tags to HTML::AsSubs.

 o  HTTP::Request::Common will read uploaded files in binmode().
    This should be better for Win32 systems.  Contributed by

    The formatters handling of whitespace is much better now.  Thanks!

 o  HTML::FormatText: can specify margins in the constructor.

 o  URI::URL: the base will be absolutized internally now.

 o  URI::URL will take advantage of void context provided by perl5.004.
    This means that using $u->path and $u->query should be safer now.

 o  URI::URL->print_on defaults to STDERR now (used to be STDOUT).

 o  URI::URL: removed version 3 compatibility stuff ($COMPAT_VER_3).

 o  $ua->mirror should work better on dosish systems (can not
    rename when target file exists).

 o  Typo in lwp-download prevented it from compiling.

 o  Some minor documentations typos corrected.



Sat Sep 20 1997   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

 o  Release 5.13

 o  Brand new module called HTTP::Cookies.  It stores cookies
    (Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 headers) from responses and can
    create appropriate Cookie headers for requests.  It can also
    share cookie files with Netscape.

 o  LWP::UserAgent now support the cookie_jar() attribute.  When
    set to an HTTP::Cookies object, it will automatically manage
    the cookies sent to the servers.  Off by default.

 o  New header utility functions in HTTP::Headers::Util.

 o  Win32 and OS/2 patches for the lwp-xxx utilities.  Turn on
    binary mode by default (option to turn it off), avoid modifying $0,
    and don't be confused about suffixes in the script names.

    HTTP::Header parameter.

 o  LWP::Protocol ensures that scheme is legal as module name.

 o  LWP::Protocol::http is not as strict when trying to verify the
    method name.  It now also accepts responses without a message
    on the status line.

    and updates to LWP::RobotUA.

 o  HTML::Parser now supports buggy Netscape comment parsing.  Enable
    it by calling $p->netscape_buggy_comment(1).  The previous version
    of the parser could also (under very unlucky and unlikely
    circumstances) call the $self->comment() method several times for
    the same comment text.

 o  HTML::Parser: Use new $p->eof to signal end of document instead of
    $p->parse(undef).

 o  HTML::Element::starttag() is now smarter about which quotes it
    use around attribute values.

 o  URI::URL:  New method ($url->rel) which does the opposite of abs().
    Example: url("http://host/a/b/c", "http://host/c/d/e")->rel would
    return url("../../a/b/c", "http://host/c/d/e").  This was
    suggested by Nicolai Langfeldt <janl@ifi.uio.no>

 o  Made $header->authorization_basic return "uname:passwd" in scalar
    context

 o  LWP::Protocol::collect() will let the HTML::HeadParser look at the
    document content as it arrives.  This will initialize headers from
    elements like <base href="...">, <title>...</title> and <meta
    http-equiv="..." ...>.

 o  Simplified $response->base implementation, because we don't have
    to look into the content any more.

    at places where we <> or print.

 o  Always localize $_ before any 'while(<FILE>) {}'-loops

 o  Implemented $protocol->collect_once() and simplified several
    of the protocol implementations by using it.

 o  The HTML parser used to get it wrong if you were unlucky about the
    breakup of the text. An example of broken behaviour was this:

Mon Nov  6 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Release 5b6

 o  Installation should work better for those that still runs
    perl4 as 'perl'.  The mirror script is not installed by
    default.

 o  LWP::Socket::_getaddress() Numerical IP addresses did not work.

 o  LWP::Socket::pushback() did not work.  This also avoids the bad
    pp_select() core dump from perl.

 o  LWP::IO now also selects on socket exceptions.

 o  HTML::Parse:  Ignore <!DOCTYPE ...> regardless for case.  Some
    bad insertElement() calls made infinite loops.

    hole with the old implementation of getBasicCredentials().

 o  LWP::Protocol::file now sets Content-Encoding headers

 o  Allow request content to be provided by a callback routine.

 o  Fix bug that prevented response callback to work.  The first parameter
    (data) is no longer a reference, because $_[0] is already a reference.
    Don't callback unless successful response.  Callbacks during redirects
    was confusing.

 o  URI::URL.  Remove port from netloc if it is the default port.
    Don't use anything, just require.

 o  HTTP::Message->addContent() does not need a reference parameter.

 o  LWP::Socket->open() has been renamed top LWP::Socket->connect()
    LWP::Socket->close has gone.  Implemented new method LWP::Socket->read()

    functions.

 o  Setting $url->scheme now changes the class of the object.

 o  Made $httpurl->user() and $httpurl->password() illegal.
    Likewise for other URL schemes.

 o  Reorganisation as discussed on <libwww-perl@ics.uci.edu>
       LWP::Date       --> HTTP::Date
       LWP::MIMEheader --> HTTP::Headers
       LWP::StatusCode --> HTTP::Status
       LWP::Message    --> HTTP::Message
       LWP::Request    --> HTTP::Request
       LWP::Response   --> HTTP::Response
       LWP::MIMEtypes  --> LWP::MediaTypes

    files that are autoloaded when used.  Self test moved to "t/uri.t".


       
Mon Aug  7 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Applied patch from Marc Hedlund <hedlund@best.com>
       - Update the @header_order according to the August 3rd draft.
       - Added Response Header fields: 'Location', 'Public', 'Retry-After',
         'Server', and 'WWW-Authenticate'.
       - Moved 'unknown header' handling from &scan to &header. The old
         implementation was forcing all unknown header-words to begin with
	 an uppercase (as it should be), but disallowed other uppercase
	 letters.
       - updates the status code messages under the August
         3rd HTTP/1.0 draft.  '203' became 'Non-Authoritative Information',
	 '303' became 'See Other', and a new code,
	 '411 Authorization Refused', was added.

 o  Can remove multiple headers with single removeHeader() call in MIMEheader.

 o  Can assign multiple field/value pairs in header() method of MIMEheader.

 o  A field with multiple values is printed as separate values in
    MIMEheader::as_string().

 o  LWP::Response contain new attributes: previous() and request().  These
    attributes are updated by the UserAgent.

 o  Appended \n to some die statements in Socket so that line numbers are
    suppressed in error messages.

 o  Made UserAgent::clone work for reference members

 o  Check for redirect loops and multiple authorization failures by
    examination of the response chain.

 o  Use "\015\012" instead of "\r\n" in protocol modules.  Some systems
    define \r and \n differently.

 o  request program can now handle documents that needs authorization by
    prompting the user for username/password. Added new -S option to print
    request/response chain.

Fri Jul 14 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Reorganized directories.  Moved LWP.pm up.  Moved file.pm and http.pm
    into the LWP::Protocol directory.  Moved LWP out of the lib directory
    and removed lib.

 o  Implemented the "get" and "mirror" scripts in the "bin" directory.

 o  Implemented "install-lwp", "update_version" and "make-dist".  The library
    version number is found in the VERSION file.

 o  Always adds 1900 to the year in LWP::Date

 o  In LWP::MIMEheader:  Implemented clone(), removeHeader() and scan() 
    methods.  Reimplemented asString.  Removed asMIME().  Moved "Good
    Practice" into this file, and reimplemented it.

 o  Moved "header" and "content" into LWP::Message class.  This change made
    LWP::Request and LWP::Response much simpler.  Made clone() method
    actually work.

 o  LWP::Protocol::implementor does not die if it cannot load package.

 o  Moved UserAgent convenience methods into LWP::Simple.  Made LWP::Simple
    export LWP::StatusCode symbols and functions.

 o  Implemented $ua->isProtocolSupported($scheme) method.

 o  Nicer directory listing in LWP::Protocol::file.pm

 o  Rely on URI::URL 3.00 behaviour for $url->full_path

 o  Library version number now in LWP.pm.  You should be able to say
    "use LWP 1.0;" if you need at least this version.

 o  Various cleanups and arranging layout as I like it.  Use fooBar-style
    (as opposed to foo_bar style) everywhere.  This means that as_string()
    now is called asString().

 o  Added more documentation.
