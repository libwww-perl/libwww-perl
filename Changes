2003-01-24   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.69

    Include lwptut.pod contributed by Sean M. Burke C<sburke@cpan.org>.

    The lwp-request aliases GET, HEAD, POST where installed when
    no program should be.  Fixed by David Miller <dave@justdave.net>.

    lwp-rget --help don't print double usage any more.

    HTTP::Header::Util is now more reluctant to put quotes around
    token values.

    Net::HTTP: Avoid warning on unexpected EOF when reading chunk
    header.



2003-01-02   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.68

    Fix test failure for t/html/form.t when running under
    perl-5.8.0.



2003-01-01   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.67

    HTTP::Cookies::Microsoft contributed by Johnny Lee <typo_pl@hotmail.com>.
    This module makes it possible for LWP to share MSIE's cookies.

    HTML::Form supports file upload better now.  There are some
    new methods on that kind of input; file(), filename(), content()
    and headers().

    Removed unfinished test that depended on Data::Dump.

    Net::HTTP avoids exceptions in read_response_headers() with
    laxed option.  It now always assumes HTTP/0.9 on unexpected
    responses.

    HTML::Form documentation reworked.



2002-12-20   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.66

    Various patches from Sean M. Burke.  Most of them to
    match up LWP with the "Perl & LWP" book.

    LWP::DebugFile module contributed by Sean.

    LWP::Authen::Ntml contributed by James Tillman.

    HTTP::Daemon patch for Alpha by <shildreth@emsphone.com>

    The format_chunk() and write_chunk() methods of Net::HTTP
    did not work.  Bug spotted by Yale Huang <yale@sdf-eu.org>.

    The Client-Peer response header is back.



2002-05-31   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.65

    Make HTTP::Date compatible with perl 5.8.

    Try to avoid to default to overwriting /usr/bin/head 
    on MacOS X when the perl install prefix is /usr/bin.

    HTTP::Cookies fix for parsing of Netscape cookies file
    on MS Windows. Patch by by Sean M. Burke <sburke@cpan.org>.

    HTTP::Negotiate doc patch from Edward Avis <epa98@doc.ic.ac.uk>.



2002-02-09   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.64

    Simplified the Makefile.PL:
       - the scripts are not longer *.PL files

       - don't try to make symlinks for GET, HEAD, POST
         as that has not worked for a long time

       - the GET, HEAD, POST aliases for lwp-request should
         now work on Windows.
    
    HTTP::Cookies:
       - added 'clear_temporary_cookies' method;
         patch by Mike Schilli <schilli1@pacbell.net>.

       - trailing space in old cookie parameters not ignored;
         patch by Ivan Panchenko

       - protect against $SIG{__DIE__} handlers;
	 patch by Adam Newby <adam@NewsNow.co.uk>.

    LWP::Authen::Digest:
       - abort digest auth session if we fail repeatedly with
         the same username/password.

    MacOS portability patches to the test suite by
    Chris Nandor <pudge@pobox.com>.



2001-12-14   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.63

    HTTP::Negotiate: Deal with parameter names in a case
    insensitive way.  Put a little weight on the order of features
    in the Accept headers.

    LWP::UserAgent: make sure that the 'request' attribute is
    always set on the returned response.

    LWP::Protocol::http will now allow certain bad headers
    in the responses it reads.  The bad headers end up in the
    header 'Client-Junk'.

    Net::HTTP new options to the 'read_response_headers'
    method.  The option 'laxed' will make it ignore bad header
    lines.  The option 'junk_out' can be used to pass in an
    array reference.  Junk header lines are pushed onto it.

    Net::HTTP::Methods: fixed the internal zlib_ok() to also
    return the correct value the first time.

    LWP::Protocol::http: Ensure that we don't read until
    select has said it is ok since we have put the socket
    in non-blocking mode.  Previously this could happen if
    you set the 'timeout' attribute of the user agent to 0.

    LWP::Authen::Digest now use Digest::MD5 instead of MD5.

    Some adjustments to Makefile.PL to figure out if
    Compress::Zlib is available and adjust the test suite
    accordingly.



2001-11-21   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.62

    The $VERSION of LWP::UserAgent wrapped around.  This confused the
    CPAN indexer.  Bumped the major number to 2 to fix this.

    Net::HTTP did not work well on perl5.003.  The PeerHost argument
    to IO::Socket::INET was not recognized, so we had to use PeerAddr
    instead.  The syswrite() method also required a length argument.

    Net::HTTP did not deal with transfer encoding tokens in a
    case-insensitive way.  Patch by Blair Zajac <blair@orcaware.com>.

    The jigsaw-chunk test failed on MacOS because "\n" is different.
    Patch by Chris Nandor <pudge@pobox.com>.



2001-11-16   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.61

    LWP::Protocol::http did not invoke its _fixup_header method.
    The result was that the 'Host' header got completely wrong
    when talking through a proxy server.

    The live Google test is gone.  They blocked us.

    The guts of Net::HTTP has moved to Net::HTTP::Methods.

    Net::HTTP now has limits on the size of the header which are
    set by default.

    New module Net::HTTPS.

    Documentation tweaks.

    HTTP::Headers: The 'remove_header' method now return the values
    of the fields removed as suggested by Blair Zajac <blair@orcaware.com>.
    Also a typo fix by Blair.

    HTTP::Message: The delegation via &AUTOLOAD should be slightly
    faster now.  It will install a real forwarding function the
    first time it is called for each HTTP::Headers method.

    LWP::UserAgent: Don't forward 'Cookie' headers on redirect.
    Patch by Steve A Fink <steve@fink.com>.

    LWP::Protocol::http has been reorganized to make it simpler
    to subclass it. Other minor changes to it include:
       - Client-Warning is gone
       - Client-Request-Num renamed to Client-Response-Num
       - A 'Transfer-Encoding' header is rewritten into a
         'Client-Transfer-Encoding' header.

    LWP::Protocol::https is completely redone.



2001-10-26   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.60

    Made HTTP/1.1 the default.  The old HTTP/1.0 module has been
    renamed as LWP::Protocol::http10.  There is an environment
    variable; PERL_LWP_USE_HTTP_10 that can be set to have LWP
    still pick up the old drivers.

    Deal with "100 continue" responses even when not requested by
    and Expect header in the request.  MS IIS seems to eager to send
    this kind of response.

    For HTTP/1.1 over SSL there was a problem with the underlying
    SSL libraries if the socket was configured to non-blocking mode.
    Disable this for https.
    Based on a patch from Michael Thompson <mickey@berkeley.innomedia.com>

    Support the Range header for ftp:// requests.
    Patch by David Coppit <david@coppit.org>.

    Rearrange Bundle::LWP on request from Chris Nandor.

    HTTP::Cookies: Allow a domain like .foo.com match host "foo.com".
    Patch by Alexandre Duret-Lutz <duret_g@lrde.epita.fr>

    For redirects make sure Host header is not copied to the new
    request.

    The HTML::HeadParser is not loaded until actually needed.

    Net::HTTP should now work with perl5.005 by a simple tweak
    to 'require IO::Socket::INET'.

    WWW::RobotRules::AnyDBM: Explicitly clear database on open.
    Some DBM implementations doesn't support the O_TRUNC flag
    properly.  Patch by Radu Greab <radu@netsoft.ro>.



2001-09-19   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53_97

    LWP::Protocol::http11: fix socket leak.  Because we managed
    to set up a circular reference within the sockets objects they
    stayed around forever.

    LWP::UserAgent: Split up simple_request into prepare_request
    and send_request. Patch contributed by Keiichiro Nagano <knagano@sodan.org>

    LWP::Protocol::http: Pass all header data to LWP::Debug::conns.
    Based on patch by Martijn.

    LWP::UserAgent: Sean fixed a Cut&Paste error.

    HTTP::Cookies: avoid pack("c",...) warning from bleadperl.



2001-08-27   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53_96

    HTTP/1.1 support also for https.
    Contributed by Doug MacEachern <dougm@covalent.net>

    The HTTP/1.1 modules are now enabled by default.  Hope that will give
    them more testing than they otherwise would have gotten.

    HTTP::Daemon's accept now has same behaviour as IO::Socket's
    accept in list context.  Fixed by Blair Zajac <blair@gps.caltech.edu>.

    More argument sanity checking in HTTP::Request->uri and
    LWP::UserAgent->simple_request.  Patch by Sean M. Burke.

    HTTP::Protocol::http.  Deal with short writes.
    Patch by Norton Allen <allen@huarp.harvard.edu>

    HTTP::Protocol::http11:  Deal with newlines in header values.

    Net::HTTP: call sysread (instead of xread) when more data is required.



2001-08-06   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53_95

    Fix HTTP::Cookies where there is a mix of Set-Cookie and
    Set-Cookie2 headers.  In that case we used to ignore all Set-Cookie
    headers.  Now we only ignore those Set-Cookie headers that reference
    the same cookie as a Set-Cookie2 header.

    HTTP::Request, HTTP::Response will by default now use "URI" class,
    instead of "URI::URL", when constructing its URI objects.  This
    has a potential for breaking existing code as URI::URL objects had
    some extra methods that external code might depend upon.

    Patches by Sean M. Burke:
       - Fix treatment of language tags in HTTP::Negotiate 
       - Avoid trailing newline in $response->message
       - HTTP::Response clarifications

    LWP::Simple deals with non-absolute redirects "correctly" now.

    Net::HTTP does not try to load Compress::Zlib until it is needed.

    Net::HTTP documentation has been updated.



2001-05-05   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53_94

    Sean M. Burke's update to LWP::UserAgent:
       - updated redirect_ok behaviour
       - new convenience methods: get/head/post/put
       - protocols_allowed/protocols_forbidden
       - LWP::Protocol::nogo (new module)

    Added digest auth test against Jigsaw

    Fixed a 'use of uninitialized'-warning in the handling of
    digest authentication.

    Net::HTTP updates:
      - new option: SendTE
      - support transfer-encoding 'deflate' and 'gzip' (when Compress::Zlib
        is available).
      - new methods: format_chunk, format_chunk_eof
      - use -1 (instead of "0E0" as signal that no data was available,
        but this was not EOF).



2001-04-28   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53_93

    Makefile.PL now asks some questions

    Added live tests for the new HTTP/1.1 support

    LWP::MemberMixin: make it possible to set a value to the 'undef' value.

    Net::HTTP:
        - transparent support for 'deflate' and 'gzip' transfer encodings
          (need to have the Compress::Zlib module installed for this to work).



2001-04-25   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53_92

    LWP::Protocol::ftp now support keep-alives too.  The command
    connection will stay open if keep-alives are enabled.

    LWP::Protocol::http11 various fixes:
        - chunked request content did not work
        - monitor connection while sending request content
        - deal with Expect: 100-continue

    LWP::RobotUA: Protect host_port call.  Not all URIs have this method.



2001-04-20   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53_91

    Introduced LWP::ConnCache module.  Works similar to HTTP::Cookies,
    it that it takes effect if associated with the $ua.

    The handling of $ua->max_size changed to make 0 mean 0
    (not unlimited).  An value of undef means no limit.
    The X-Content-Base header is gone.  I hope nobody relies on
    it.  It might come back if people start to scream.  There
    is a new Client-Aborted header instead.

    The Range header generated for $ua->max_size had a off-by-one
    error.  A range of "0-1" means 2 bytes.

    The LWP::UserAgent constructor now takes configuration arguments.

    Keep-alive and the new HTTP/1.1 module can now be simply
    enabled with something like:

          LWP::UserAgent->new(keep_alive => 1);

    New method $ua->conn_cache to set up and access the associated
    connection manager.

    If the string passed to $ua->agent() ends with space then
    the "libwww-perl/#.##" string is automatically appended.

    New method $ua->_agent

    Passing a plain hash to $ua->cookie_jar automatically loads
    HTTP::Cookies and initialise an object using the hash content
    as constructor arguments.

    LWP::Protocol::http11 now use the conn_cache of the $ua.

    LWP::Protocol::http11 now added a few new Client- headers.

    LWP::Protocol avoid keeping the connection alive if $ua->max_size
    limit prevents the whole body content from being read.

    Net::HTTP updates:
       - new methods: write_chunk(), write_chunk_eof()
       - reset state properly when a new body is read.
       - always set read buffer empty on eof
       - doc update

    WWW::RobotRules patch by Liam Quinn <liam@htmlhelp.com>:
       - Always qualify netloc with port.
       - Reverse User-Agent substring matching.



2001-04-18   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53_90

    Note: This is a developer only release.  Not for production use.

    LWP::Protocol::http11 now does keep-alives by default.  Still need
    to figure out what interface to provide at the $ua level.

    LWP::Protocol::http11 deals with CODE content in request.

    Net::HTTP updated:
        - added format_request() method
        - added _rbuf and _rbuf_length methods
        - read_response_headers does not return protocol version
	  any more.
        - peer_http_version method did not work because of typo.
        - documentation added

    New module Net::HTTP::NB.  This is a Net::HTTP subclass that
    is better suited for multiplexing as it is able to do no-blocking
    reads of headers and entity body chunks.

    HTTP::Request: Protect $request->uri against evil $SIG{__DIE__} handlers.

    Some reorganisation in how stuff is passed from $ua to protocol object.
    The $ua is now passed in so protocol objects might store start in it.

    The $ua->max_size default is now 0.

    The $ua->clone method avoids sharing of proxy settings between
    the old and the new.

    This file is renamed to 'Changes' (used to be 'ChangeLog').



2001-04-10   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.53

    LWP::Simple::get() could sometimes return nothing on failure in
    list context.  Now it always returns 'undef'.

    HTTP::Cookies does not request 2 dots on domain names any more.
    New option to hide the Cookie2 header.  Cookie2 header now quote
    the version number. Updated reference to RFC 2965.

    Support for embedded userinfo in http proxy URIs.  It means that
    you know can set up your proxy with things like:
        http_proxy="http://proxyuser:proxypass@proxyhost:port"
    Patch by John Klar <j.klar@xpedite.com>.

    Experimental HTTP/1.1 support.  New module called Net::HTTP that
    provide the lower level interface and a LWP::Protocol::http11
    module that builds on it.  The HTTP/1.1 protocol module must be
    loaded and registered explicitly, otherwise the old and trustworthy
    HTTP/1.0 module will be used.

    LWP::Protocol::GHTTP will try to use the get_headers() methods
    so that it can actually extract all the headers.



2001-03-29   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.52

    HTTP::Header: new method $h->init_header() that will only
    set the header if it is not already set.  Some shuffling
    around in the code.

    LWP::UserAgent will not override 'User-Agent', 'From'
    or 'Range' headers if they are explicitly set in the
    request passed in.

    HTML::Form tries to optimize parsing be restricting the
    tags that are reported by HTML::Parser.  Will need
    HTML::Parser v3.19_93 or better for this to actually
    have any effect.

    LWP::Protocol::ftp now deals with path parameters again.
    It means that you can append ";type=a" to ftp-URI and
    it will download the document in ASCII mode.

    If the server output multiple Location headers on a redirect,
    ignore all but the first one.

    Extract cookies failed on request URIs with empty paths.
    This was only triggered if you used URI objects directly in
    scripts.

    This change was actually part of 5.51:  Fix qop="auth"
    handling for Digest authentication.
    Patch by Dave Dunkin <dave_dunkin@hotmail.com>.



2001-03-14   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.51

    SECURITY FIX: If LWP::UserAgent::env_proxy is called in a CGI
    environment, the case-insensitivity when looking for "http_proxy"
    permits "HTTP_PROXY" to be found, but this can be trivially set by the
    web client using the "Proxy:" header.  The fix applied is that
    $ENV{HTTP_PROXY} is not longer honored for CGI scripts.
    The CGI_HTTP_PROXY environment variable can be used instead.
    Problem reported by Randal L. Schwartz.

    NOTE: It is recommended that everybody that use LWP::UserAgent
          (including LWP::Simple) in CGI scripts upgrade to this release.

    Explicit setting of action on HTML::Form had no effect because
    of a code typo.  Patch by BooK <book@netcourrier.com>.

    HTTP::Daemon: The CONNECT method need special treatment because
    it does not provide a URI as argument (just a "hostname:port").
    The non-upward compatibility warning is that you must now call
    $request->url->host_port to get the host/port string for CONNECT,
    rather than calling $request->url and using the entire string.
    Based on patch from Randal L. Schwartz <merlyn@stonehenge.com>

    HTTP::Daemon: Create self URL based on $self->sockaddr.  This works
    better when LocalAddr is used to specify the port number.  Based on
    patch from Ben Low <ben@snrc.uow.edu.au>. 

    Avoid potential '<FILE> chunk 1' messages at the end of the response
    'message'.



2001-01-12   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.50

    Fix for test cases that failed because of URI-1.10 now encode
    space as '+' instead of '%20. Patch by Christian Gilmore
    <cgilmore@tivoli.com>.

    Makefile.PL: Require URI-1.10.

    HTTP::Daemon now accepts any non-space character as method name
    on the request line.  It used to fail on methods like "M-POST"
    because it only allowed \w-chars.

    HTTP::Date now allow fractional seconds in ISO date formats.
    Based on patch from Mark D. Anderson <mda@discerning.com>

    HTTP::Request::Common will now calculate Content-length
    even if $DYNAMIC_FILE_UPLOAD is set.  Patch provided by
    Lindley, Lee T <Lee.Lindley@viasystems.com>.



2000-12-31   Gisle Aas <gisle@ActiveState.com>

    Release 5.49

    HTML::Form: Use croak() instead of die.  Implement
    $f->possible_values.  Avoid use of undef value warnings.

    HTTP::Cookies: fix epath issue.  Make it work for URI::http
    as the uri-attribute of HTTP::Request object

    HTTP::Date: Allow ignored timezone info in parenthesis. Patch
    by Sander van Zoest <sander@covalent.net>.
    Fix calculation of non-GMT timezones (wrong sign).  Patch by
    KONISHI Katsuhiro <konishi@din.or.jp>.

    HTTP::Response: Let $res->base() absolutize the URI.  Based on
    bug report from Hans de Graaff <hans@degraaff.org>.

    Fixed minor doc typos in HTTP::Headers::Util and LWP::UserAgent.

    HTTP::Request::Common: Support boundary spec from client.

    LWP::Simple: Avoid trivial_http_get when @ appears in authority
    part of URI

    LWP::Authen::Digest: Need to have query in URI param. 
    Spotted by <ronald@innovation.ch>.

    LWP::Protocol::http: unescape username/password if they are
    specified in the URI.

    Added LWP::Protocol::GHTTP.  This allow LWP to use the HTTP::GHTTP
    module as the low level HTTP driver.



2000-04-09   Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no>

    Release 5.48

    README.SSL update by Marko Asplund <aspa@hip.fi>

    $request->uri($uri) will now always store a copy of the $uri.

    HTTP::Status: Added status codes from RFC 2616 and RFC 2518 (WebDAV)

    LWP::RobotUA will not parse robots.txt unless content type and
    content sample looks right.

    LWP::UserAgent: Deal with multiple WWW-Authenticate headers.
    Patch by Hugo <hv@crypt.compulink.co.uk>

    $ua->proxy can now return the old proxy settings without
    destroying the old one.
    Based on patch by Benjamin Low <ben@snrc.uow.edu.au>

    LWP::Protocol::http update

        - don't terminate header parsing on bad headers
        - extra_sock_opts
        - preparations for keep alive support

   WWW::RobotRules deal with various absolute URIs in the
   disallow lines.

   Makefile.PL: Make sure we have HTML::TokeParser

   Clean test on VMS.

    Additional entry point is parse_date().  This function avoid any
    limitations caused by the time-representation (seconds since
    epoch).

 o  Y2K fix to t/base/cookies.t.  Netscape's original cookie
    example expires at 09-Nov-99.

    Send back cookies to any port, and allow origin host name to
    be specified as domain, and still be treated as a domain.
    Patch from Andreas Gustafsson <gson@araneus.fi>.

 o  HTTP::Cookies now ignore the Expires field in Set-Cookie, if the
    date provided can't be parsed by HTTP::Date.

    Sys::Hostname::hostname().  This avoid some test failures in
    the test suite for people with upper- or mixed-cased hostnames.

 o  LWP::Protocol::gopher: IO::Socket::INET ctor did not specify
    Proto => 'tcp'.  This made it less portable to older IO::Socket
    versions.

    'perl Makefile.PL LIB=/my/lib'

 o  LWP bundle mention Digest::MD5 instead of MD5

 o  headers-auth.t test suite bug triggered by perl5.005_5x.
    Patch by Albert Dvornik <bert@genscan.com>

    before passing it to the authentication module.  Previous releases
    ignored parameters like; Realm="Foo" (bacause Realm contained
    upper case letters).

 o  LWP::Protocol::ftp test for If-Modified-Since was wrong.

 o  How the $url->abs method works can now be configured with the global
    variables $URI::URL::ABS_ALLOW_RELATIVE_SCHEME and

    It means that 'lwp-request perl' will not get a file called "./perl"
    but will fetch the page "http://www.perl.com" or something similar.
    If you want to get the file you have to prefix it with "./".  Full
    URLs are never affected by this.

    should make it somewhat faster.

 o  LWP::RobotUA has a new method called $ua->use_sleep() that

    document better. Initial patch from Nicolai Langfeldt
    <janl@math.uio.no>.

 o  URI::URL will take advantage of void context provided by perl5.004.
    This means that using $u->path and $u->query should be safer now.

 o  URI::URL->print_on defaults to STDERR now (used to be STDOUT).

 o  URI::URL: removed version 3 compatibility stuff ($COMPAT_VER_3).

 o  $ua->mirror should work better on dosish systems (can not
    rename when target file exists).

 o  Typo in lwp-download prevented it from compiling.

 o  Some minor documentations typos corrected.

    (Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 headers) from responses and can
    create appropriate Cookie headers for requests.  It can also
    share cookie files with Netscape.

    it by calling $p->netscape_buggy_comment(1).  The previous version
    of the parser could also (under very unlucky and unlikely
    circumstances) call the $self->comment() method several times for
    the same comment text.

 o  HTML::Parser: Use new $p->eof to signal end of document instead of
    $p->parse(undef).

 o  HTML::Element::starttag() is now smarter about which quotes it
    use around attribute values.

 o  New HTTP::Response methods: current_age(), freshness_lifetime(),
    is_fresh(), fresh_until().

 o  HTTP::Message:  New method ($mess->content_ref) which will return
    a reference to the current content.

 o  URI::URL:  New method ($url->rel) which does the opposite of abs().
    Example: url("http://host/a/b/c", "http://host/c/d/e")->rel would
    return url("../../a/b/c", "http://host/c/d/e").  This was
    suggested by Nicolai Langfeldt <janl@ifi.uio.no>

 o  URI::URL:  $url->query_form can now take array references as value
    specification.  For instance: $url->query_form(foo => ['bar', 'baz']

 o  Avoid '"my" variable $var masks earlier declaration in same scope'
    warnings in perl5.003_05.

 o  Made $header->authorization_basic return "uname:passwd" in scalar
    context

 o  LWP::Protocol::collect() will let the HTML::HeadParser look at the
    document content as it arrives.  This will initialize headers from
    elements like <base href="...">, <title>...</title> and <meta
    http-equiv="..." ...>.

 o  Simplified $response->base implementation, because we don't have
    to look into the content any more.

    at places where we <> or print.

 o  Always localize $_ before any 'while(<FILE>) {}'-loops

 o  Implemented $protocol->collect_once() and simplified several
    of the protocol implementations by using it.

 o  The HTML parser used to get it wrong if you were unlucky about the
    breakup of the text. An example of broken behaviour was this:

    the we continued to read 0 bytes in a busy loop until the alarm()
    killed us.

 o  Added support for Digest Access Authentication.  Contributed by
    Doug MacEachern <dougm@osf.org>.

    It also inserts a <BASE> tag in directories instead of a redirect.

 o  MIME::Base64 routines can be called as MIME::Base64::encode() and
    MIME::Base64::decode().  Same kind of thing for QuotedPrint.



Mon Nov  6 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Release 5b6

 o  Installation should work better for those that still runs
    perl4 as 'perl'.  The mirror script is not installed by
    default.

 o  LWP::Socket::_getaddress() Numerical IP adresses did not work.

 o  LWP::Socket::pushback() did not work.  This also avoids the bad
    pp_select() core dump from perl.

 o  LWP::IO now also selects on socket exceptions.

 o  HTML::Parse:  Ignore <!DOCTYPE ...> regardless for case.  Some
    bad insertElement() calls made infinite loops.

Sat Sep 16 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Release 5b5

 o  newlocal URI::URL does not put "//localhost" into the URLs any

    completness sake.  Routine names has changed as suggested by Tim
    Bunce.

 o  LWP::MediaType reads default types from media.types file.
    guessMediaType() now also returns encodings.  New function mediaSuffix()

 o  Pass $url to $ua->getBasicCredentials().  This also fixes security
    hole with the old implementation of getBasicCredentials().

 o  LWP::Protocol::file now sets Content-Encoding headers

 o  Allow request content to be provided by a callback routine.

 o  Fix bug that prevented response callback to work.  The first parameter
    (data) is no longer a reference, because $_[0] is already a reference.
    Don't callback unless successful response.  Callbacks during redirects
    was confusing.

 o  URI::URL.  Remove port from netloc if it is the default port.
    Don't use anything, just require.

 o  HTTP::Message->addContent() does not need a reference parameter.

 o  LWP::Socket->open() has been renamed top LWP::Socket->connect()
    LWP::Socket->close has gone.  Implemented new method LWP::Socket->read()
    that returns as fast as it has some data to offer.  Implemented
    LWP::Socket->pushback().

 o  Does not die in LWP::UserAgent->request()

 o  LWP::Socket now use LWP::IO for low level IO

       LWP::Date       --> HTTP::Date
       LWP::MIMEheader --> HTTP::Headers
       LWP::StatusCode --> HTTP::Status
       LWP::Message    --> HTTP::Message
       LWP::Request    --> HTTP::Request
       LWP::Response   --> HTTP::Response
       LWP::MIMEtypes  --> LWP::MediaTypes

    files that are autoloaded when used.  Self test moved to "t/uri.t".


       
Mon Aug  7 1995   Gisle Aas <aas@oslonett.no>

 o  Applied patch from Marc Hedlund <hedlund@best.com>
       - Update the @header_order according to the August 3rd draft.
       - Added Response Header fields: 'Location', 'Public', 'Retry-After',
         'Server', and 'WWW-Authenticate'.
       - Moved 'unknown header' handling from &scan to &header. The old
         implementation was forcing all unknown header-words to begin with
	 an uppercase (as it should be), but disallowed other uppercase
	 letters.
       - updates the status code messages under the August
         3rd HTTP/1.0 draft.  '203' became 'Non-Authoritative Information',
	 '303' became 'See Other', and a new code,
	 '411 Authorization Refused', was added.

 o  Can remove multiple headers with single removeHeader() call in MIMEheader.

 o  Can assign multiple field/value pairs in header() method of MIMEheader.

 o  A field with multiple values is printed as separate values in
    MIMEheader::as_string().

 o  LWP::Response contain new attributes: previous() and request().  These
    attributes are updated by the UserAgent.

 o  Appended \n to some die statements in Socket so that line numbers are
    suppressed in error messages.

 o  Made UserAgent::clone work for reference members

 o  Check for redirect loops and multiple authorization failures by
    examination of the response chain.

 o  Use "\015\012" instead of "\r\n" in protocol modules.  Some systems
    define \r and \n differently.

 o  request program can now handle documents that needs autorization by
    prompting the user for username/password. Added new -S option to print
    request/response chain.
